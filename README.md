### Elevator Pitch

Are you wanting to test your odds? Missing carnival games? Or just bored and looking for a new game? Cups of Fortune is a simple game that will cure all three ailments. Once logged in a member will be given the chance to pick a cup and see what fortune they get. Once a cup is chosen a fortune will be revealed. This fortune can range from Good Luck, Mediocre Luck, to Bad Luck. Which doesn't change much.

...unless you believe in superstitions?
